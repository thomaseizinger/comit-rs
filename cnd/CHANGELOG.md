## [Unreleased]

## [cnd-0.9.0] - 2020-09-23

### Added

-   A set of API endpoints that expose the decentralized orderbook functionality.

### Changed

-   **Breaking Change** Remove support for RFC003 swaps
-   **Breaking Change** Config directory for MacOS changed from `/Users/<user>/Library/Preferences/comit/` to `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/comit/`.

## [0.8.0] - 2020-06-12

### Fixed

-   Fix windows build.

### Changed

-   **Breaking Change**: Rename `parity` to `geth` in the configuration file as we are only testing the software with Geth as part of the CI.

### Added

-   Support for `herc20-halbit`, `halbit-herc20`, `hbit-herc20` and `herc20-hbit` swaps.

## [0.7.3] - 2020-04-14

### Fixed

-   Deserialization problem of bitcoind's response: Bitcoind returns as chain/network either `main`,`test` or `regtest`. This fix was manually tested against bitcoind (0.17, 0.18 and 0.19).

### Changed

-   Ensure that lnd parameters are defaulted if not present.

## [0.7.2] - 2020-03-26

## [0.7.1] - 2020-03-12

### Fixed

-   The release workflow for GitHub Actions was unfortunately broken.

### Added

-   Linting of GitHub Actions workflows to prevent silly mistakes in the future.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-03-12

### Added

-   Added a step during initialisation to test whether the chain/network id's of the Ethereum/Bitcoin nodes that cnd has connected to matches the chain/network id's specified in the config. Cnd will abort if the config and the actual chain/network id does not match. Cnd will log a warning if it cannot make a request to the nodes.

### Changed

-   **Breaking config changes**: cnd config has changed. Bitcoin and Ethereum has 2 optional fields specifically for the connector (i.e. bitcoind and parity). If provided, the network (for bitcoin) and chain_id (for ethereum) are mandatory. If the url was not provided, a default aiming at localhost will be derived. If no connectors were provided, defaults will be provided. For a full example config run: `cnd --dump-config`.

## [0.6.0] - 2020-02-13

### Fixed

-   Ensure that failed Ethereum transactions are ignored during a swap.

### Changed

-   Upgrade `blockchain-contracts` crate to 0.3.1. Ether and Erc20 HTLCs now use `revert` to fail the Ethereum transaction if the redeem or refund are unsuccessful.

## [0.5.1] - 2020-01-21

### Added

-   Return Siren document containing peer ID, listen addresses and links to `/swaps` and `/swaps/rfc003` on `GET /` with the Accept request HTTP header set to `application/vnd.siren+json`.

### Changed

-   Write all diagnostics and log messages to stderr.

## [0.5.0] - 2019-12-06

### Added

-   Added persistent storage to cnd, now we save swaps to an Sqlite database when they are requested and accepted.
-   Use stdlib `SocketAddr` as base for HTTP API config option.

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-26

### Changed

-   **Breaking (HTTP+COMIT API):** Change the identity for the Bitcoin Ledger from a public key hash to a public key. This change impacts the HTTP and the COMIT API of cnd.
-   **Breaking (COMIT API):**  Replace Ethereum `network` with Ethereum `chain_id`
-   cnd no longer automatically generates a config file, but instead simply defaults to what it would have written to the file on first startup.
-   Make expiries optional when sending a swap request, with defaults:
    -   24 hours later for alpha ledger.
    -   12 hours later for beta ledger.
-   **Breaking (Config file format):** Expand `http_api` section in config file to contain both the socket and CORS settings.

### Added

-   Return Ethereum `chain_id` on the HTTP API.
-   Support Ethereum `chain_id` in the Swap Request (HTTP API).
-   Ability to set CORS allowed origins through the configuration file.
-   Added command line option `--dump-config` to print the running configuration to stdout.

### Fixed

-   Error responses now properly identify themselves as `application/problem+json`. They have been conforming to this format for a while already, we just never set the `Content-Type` header properly. From now on, applications can fully rely on the error format!

## [0.3.0] - 2019-10-02

### Changed

-   Embed btsieve as a library inside cnd: From now on, you'll only need to run cnd to use COMIT.

## [0.2.1] - 2019-09-24

### Changed

-   Use the same Swap ID to identify a swap for both parties.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-09-13

### Changed

-   Statically link openssl in the release build to allow the binaries to be ran out-of-the-box on most Linux distros.
-   Replace ZMQ by using bitcoind's HTTP API for retrieving bitcoin blocks.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-09-05

### Added

-   All the code since the dawn of comit-rs.
-   Check if btsieve's version matches the expected version, on every request.
-   Ping btsieve on cnd startup, checking for presence and version compatibility.

### Changed

-   Move config files to standard location based on platform (OSX, Windows, Linux).
-   Align implementation with RFC-002 to use the decision header instead of status codes.
